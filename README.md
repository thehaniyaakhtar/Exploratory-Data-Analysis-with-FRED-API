## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis with FRED API

This project demonstrates how to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using data fetched from the **FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)** API. The notebook includes fetching economic indicators, visualizing time series trends, and deriving insights from macroeconomic data.

### 📁 File Overview

- `EDA_with_FredAPI.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook that fetches economic indicators using the FRED API and performs time series analysis and visualization.

---

### 🔑 FRED API Key

To access the FRED API, you'll need an API key from [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). Once obtained, you can set it up like this in the notebook:

### 📌 Features

- Connects to the FRED API to retrieve economic data.
- Visualizes economic indicators
- Uses line plots to explore trends.
- Prepares data for further analysis or forecasting.

---

### 📈 Sample Visualizations

- GDP growth over time
- Unemployment rate trends
- Participation rate trends
- State wise comparison across USA

---

### 📚 Use Cases

- Educational resource for learning how to work with APIs and economic data.
- Baseline for building financial data dashboards or economic forecasting models.
- Time series analysis and macroeconomic EDA.

---

### ✅ Future Improvements

- Add interactive plots with Plotly
- Extend to forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, etc.)
- Build a dashboard with Streamlit
